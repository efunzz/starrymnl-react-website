# Starrymnl Frontend Website

This project is a frontend website inspired by the Instagram page **Starrymnl**. I built this as a personal project to practice frontend development skills, particularly using **React**, **Chakra UI**, and **Tailwind CSS** to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

The design and layout were inspired by Starrymnlâ€™s aesthetic, and while I shared the work with the owner of the page, it was not used in an official capacity. This project remains a personal showcase of what I learned and implemented.
